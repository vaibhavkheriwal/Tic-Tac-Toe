# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview
This game was my final year project for my **Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)** degree.  
It demonstrates my understanding and application of programming concepts through the development of a digital version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

The game board, rules, and winner determination logic are implemented using **Visual Studio .NET**.  
The user interface is designed to be intuitive and interactive, allowing two players to enjoy the game on a 3x3 grid.
